As a detail oriented individual, I've always excelled at working with numbers and I first developed an interest in banking while being a teller. This led to an unexpected passion for analyzing data!

After graduating from high school, I decided to join the workforce and I got hired by Citibank. While I thoroughly enjoyed my time in banking and learned a lot, I wanted to work on the analytical side of things.

Thatâ€™s when I discovered the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics program, an immersive 4-month bootcamp. During the program, I delved deep into the realms of Python, SQL, data visualization, and Power BI. Now equipped with proficient skills in data analysis and visualization, I'm eager to apply my knowledge with a focus on driving growth.

In my personal time, I'm an active gym goer and I love pumping iron!
