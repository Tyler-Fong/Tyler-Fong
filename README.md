While I thoroughly enjoyed my time in banking and learned a lot, I realized that the customer service aspect of the job wasn't the right fit for me.

Thatâ€™s when I discovered the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics program, an immersive 4-month bootcamp. During the program, I delved deep into the realms of Python, SQL, data visualization, and power BI. Now equipped with proficient skills in data analysis and visualization, I'm eager to apply my knowledge with a focus on driving growth.

In my personal time, I'm an active gym goer and I love pumping iron!

Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. If you happen to know of any data analyst positions that align with my interests and skills, I would greatly appreciate your recommendations.</p>
